## Packet Spoofing
We can't use typical socket programming for packet spoofing due to limited flexibility. 
In socket programming we will only have controls over few selected fields in the header. 
For example, we can set the destination IP address but not the source IP address.

For instance consider the following attacks:

1. TCP SYN flooding : flooding with randomly generated source IP address
2. TCP session hijacking attack : Attackers use victim's IP address, correct sequence numbers and port numbers in the TCP header.
3. DNS cache poisoning attack : Attackers need to send fake DNS replies to the victim but the packet should carry the legitimate DNS server's IP address in the source IP field.

All of these attacks involve packet spoofing technique, in which some critical information in the packet is forged.

To overcome the issues with socket programming for spoofing we use a special type of socket called raw socket. This enables us to set arbitrary values for header fields.

There are two steps in packet spoofing:

1. Constructing the packet in a buffer
2. Sending the packet out

### Sending the packet out
We will first look at how to send a packet before actually constructing one using raw sockets.

### Constructing ICMP Packets
We need to fill the buffer with header information and payload data.

1. Create a buffer of size 1500, fill it with zeros and then fill in the ICMP header. Note that payload data is optional for ICMP.


2. We then fill in the IP header by setting the source and destination IP address.


3. We can pass the pointer of the buffer to the send_raw_ip_packet() function to send our spoofed packet.

After executing the above code we can use WireShark to observe the execution result.

### Constructing UDP Packets
This is similar to above except we now include payload data. Here we try to construct a UDP packet that sends out a message "Hello World!" to the server using a spoofed IP address.


1. Create a buffer for the IP packet, and then calculate the offset for the payload.


2. We then place data (a string) into the payload region inside the buffer.

3. Then fill in the UDP headers.


4. Then fill in the IP headers


5. Finally, like before pass the pointer of the buffer to the send_raw_ip_packet() function to send our spoofed packet.

After executing above code we can run UDP server program on the server machine, and simply print out whatever received. nc -luv 9090 will do this!
