## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful branch of machine learning that focuses on solving sequential decision-making problems.
Unlike supervised learning, where an algorithm learns from labeled data, RL agents learn through interaction with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

## The RL Framework

At its core, RL is modeled as a feedback control loop between an agent and its environment.
The process follows a simple yet profound cycle: the agent observes the current state of the environment, selects an action based on its policy, and then receives a reward and transitions to a new state.
This cycle continues until the environment reaches a terminal state or the problem is solved.

## Theoretical Foundations

The foundation of RL lies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and optimal control theory.
MDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.
The Markov property assumes that the next state depends only on the current state and action, not on the history of previous states and actions.

## Key Components

Key components of an RL system include:

- States: The set of all possible situations in the environment.
- Actions: The set of all possible moves the agent can make.
- Rewards: The feedback signal that indicates the desirability of the most recent action.
- Policy: A function that maps states to actions, guiding the agent's behavior.
- Value Functions: Estimates of the expected return from a given state or state-action pair.
- Model: An optional component that predicts the next state and reward given the current state and action.

## The Goal of RL

The ultimate goal of an RL agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.
This is often expressed as the expectation of returns over many trajectories, where a trajectory is a sequence of state-action-reward tuples in an episode.

## Categories of RL Algorithms

RL algorithms can be broadly categorized into three families:

- Value-based methods: These focus on learning value functions to indirectly derive a policy.
- Policy-based methods: These directly optimize the policy without necessarily learning a value function.
- Model-based methods: These learn a model of the environment to plan and make decisions.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning combines RL with deep neural networks, allowing for more complex function approximation. A notable example is the DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm, which uses a neural network to approximate Q-values for each action in a given state.

# Benfits of RL

- Lack of oracle (no correct answer for each model input)
- Sparsity of feedback
- Data generated during training
