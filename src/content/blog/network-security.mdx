## Network Security
From Morris worm to Mitnick attack; from Mafia boy to Kaminsky attack; from Pakistan's hijacking of YouTube to Syria's shutting down of its own Internet. 
There are so many attacks on the Internet. 
If you want to learn how the Internet works, how it can be attacked, and more importantly, how you can defend against these attacks, then this blog is for you.

Over next few weeks we will explore following attacks and see how to defend ourselves against them.
1. Packet Sniffing and Spoofing
2. Attacks on the TCP Protocol
3. Firewall
4. Domain Name System (DNS) and Attacks
5. Virtual Private Network
